## Introduction to the arkwith

**Arkwith try to make a better world with customers and partner.**

Open source and cloud computing are widely used in software development and information technology services. and there is a new term called **Cloud Service Brokerage** that reflects this age. this is called a cloud service or service provider that provides expert cloud services and appropriate cloud services. It is a new terminology based on technology that provides business insight to many information technology providers and related people, and it was thought to be a concept to think about future society led by application software.

Arkwith was founded in 2016 as one-person creative enterprise to provide technologies and services that corresponds to these open-source based, cloud computing era. Since the establishment of the company, we are conducting business mainly in R & D. We studied **natural language processing and understanding** fields as main contents. It is an understanding of the human language that is an important means of communicating and acquiring knowledge of a person so that the computer understands and responds to the person. We also investigated related open source applications. We have found the appropriate ones and reused them for cloud computing services. We have also studied **ontology-based knowledge information processing application software** that allows computers to accumulate, process, and utilize knowledge by imitating knowledge recognition and reasoning of human.

## Technology and Services

### Open source based Programming Services

The architecture for developing applications has recently been divided into **Back-End** and **Front-End**. This seems to be an important architectural concept as mobile apps used in smartphones become popular. As a result, developers and development environments are implicitly classified and specialized into two areas: back-end and front-end. Arkwith also created the **Arkwith Starter Template** by applying the back-end and front-end architectural styles. It is maked using open source and is intended for **FullStack developers**. So we hope to be further developed it with FullStact developers.

The back-end area uses Python and the **Django Rest Framework** for the restful API (application programming interface). The database supports all commercial or open source based databases through the Django DBMS association module. The advantage is that you can quickly implement application programs based on business processes and data models with small amounts of coding.

The front-end area implements **SPA(Single Page Application)** and uses **React** with good reusability. It is developed using JavaScript and integrated with Bootstrap, which is famous for HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JS (JavaScript) library and UI (User Interface) and also **Material-UI**, the world's most popular React UI framework. And it can be applied to responsive web, mobile apps and existing web applications. It is easy to link with Restful API of Back-End. There is also a good development ecosystem and abundant library available.

I think it's lighter, easier to learn, and more scalable than the old Java and Spring-based enterprise development frameworks. Arkwith is developing our cloud computing based services using the Arkwith Starter Template described above. Application development technology that is easy to use in the era of cloud computing. We are preparing to provide the best application development services for our customers.

### Chatbot and Machine Learning Programming Services

As the **messenger service** becomes more common, and Chatbot has also received much attention from academia and industry. As a result, many AI speakers, such as Amazon Alexa, have been released along with the AI(Artificial Intelligence) boom. However, for consumers, availability is limited to some simple services. Unlike the initial expectation, it is known that the development of natural language processing and understanding technology is slow and limited. It is still technically difficult for a computer to communicate like a person. As this is known around academia, it seems that the expectations of industry and people are lowered and moving to other places.

In the field of **machine learning**, when comparing image processing and language processing, there is overwhelmingly a lot of image processing in related research or industrial applications. Language processing does not produce remarkable results except for translation services. Especially in the field of dialogue system, other languages seem to be more difficult than English, which has been studied for a long time.

Arkwith also has no mature technology to make a Chatbot that talks like a conversation between a person and a person. However, we have applied and programmed the latest articles in the field of machine learning and **deep learning** related to **natural language processing** and **dialogue processing**, which are the basis for the **chatbot service**. We have developed a chatbot service using open source for natural language processing, large dialogue corpus like Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus, and Deep Learning Frameworks like **Tensorflow** and **PyTorch**. In addition, we are developing applications using AI services such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Naver, etc.

We use **Python** as our development language. The machine learning library uses **scikit-learn**, **gensim**, and uses TensorFlow, PyTorch for deep running. We use **KoNLPy**, **NLTK** for natural language processing.

We are trying to acquire all of the necessary elemental technology for **AI speaker** by using open source or researching and developing directly. Such techniques include speech recognition, machine learning or deep learning using corpus and dialog rules, pattern matching, response generation, speech synthesis, and so on. Now it is a elementary level. However, I look forward to the day when I will make a chatbot that is more usable than the present through continuous efforts.
